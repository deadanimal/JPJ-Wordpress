Connect WordPress to external API's. Send data to API's or recieve and display API data using shortcode or template tag. Connecting to API's has never been easier. 

== Description ==

The easiest way to connect WordPress with external API's. WPGetAPI allows you to easily send data and get data from an unlimited number of 3rd party REST API's. You can then format and display the returned data on your WordPress website using a shortcode or a template tag.

WPGetAPI supports virtually all authentication methods including [OAuth 2.0 authorization](https://wpgetapi.com/downloads/oauth-2-0-authentication/?utm_campaign=OAuth&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=readme), Bearer token, basic auth, API keys and username/password.

[Paid extensions](https://wpgetapi.com/downloads/?utm_campaign=Extensions&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq) are available if you are looking to do more with your API.


= Can I connect to any REST API? =

Yes, most likely. WPGetAPI handles all major methods of authorization and authentication. It will depend on the type of authentication your API is using. Please click the link to view the [types of authentication and authorization](https://wpgetapi.com/docs/authentication-authorization/?utm_campaign=Docs&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq) that are available.


= Can I capture form data and send to my API? =

Yes, with our [Pro Plugin](https://wpgetapi.com/downloads/pro-plugin/?utm_campaign=Pro&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq) you can capture data from your forms and send this data to your API.

This is perfect for lead generation forms, contact forms or really any other type form that requires you to send form data to an API.


= Can I use an XML based API? =

Yes, we support XML with our [Pro Plugin](https://wpgetapi.com/downloads/pro-plugin/?utm_campaign=Pro&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq)


= How do I connect WordPress to an API? =

By using this plugin of course! Check out the video at the top of this page or visit our [Quick Start Guide](https://wpgetapi.com/docs/quick-start-guide/?utm_campaign=Quick-Start&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq) to get started with connecting your WordPress website with an API.


= How do I cache API calls? =

We support caching with our [Pro Plugin](https://wpgetapi.com/downloads/pro-plugin/?utm_campaign=Pro&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq). It also recognises dynamic queries and will cache these individually.

A dynamic query might be something like these:

/customer-endpoint/customer?user_id=123
/customer-endpoint/customer?user_id=4567

The Pro plugin recognises that whilst they are the same endpoint, they are different queries that need to be cached separately.

= Where can I find docs? =

All of our [documentation can be found here](https://wpgetapi.com/docs/?utm_campaign=Docs&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq).


= What can I do with the API data? =

The API data can be output as a JSON string, stored in a PHP variable or automatically output as HTML (using Pro plugin extension). You can easily format the data into tables or charts plus many other possibilities.


= Will you help me if I am having trouble? =

Yes! Please [contact us](https://wpgetapi.com/contact/?utm_campaign=Contact&utm_medium=wporg&utm_source=faq) and we will get your API up and running.
